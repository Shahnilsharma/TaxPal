# My New Project: TaxPal

I am excited to introduce my latest project, TaxPal! This web application was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to simplify the process of calculating and managing taxes for individuals and businesses.

## Features

TaxPal offers a range of features to make tax management easier and more efficient:

1. User-friendly interface: The application has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and input their tax information.

2. Automated calculations: TaxPal automates the tax calculation process, saving users time and reducing the risk of errors.

3. Customizable settings: Users can customize their tax settings based on their location, tax rates, and specific requirements.

4. Data storage: TaxPal securely stores user data, allowing users to access their tax information anytime, anywhere.
