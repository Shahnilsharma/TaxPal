TaxPal offers a range of features to make tax management easier and more efficient:

1. User-friendly interface: The application has a clean and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and input their tax information.

2. Interactive charts: TaxPal provides interactive charts and visualizations to help users analyze their tax data and make informed decisions.

3. Customizable settings: Users can customize their tax settings based on their location, tax rates, and specific requirements.

## Deployment

I have deployed TaxPal on Vercel, a popular platform for hosting static websites and applications. You can access the live version of TaxPal  [Here](https://tax-pal-sepia.vercel.app/).
